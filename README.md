# Boat Simulation

This repo contains a boat simulation from [Intelligent Quads](https://github.com/Intelligent-Quads/iq_sim). We have modified it to suit our needs. See our [documentation](https://iceberg-asv.gitbook.io/gazebo-simulation/) for setup and usage. This repo is specifically designed to work with the Ardupilot control system, and utilizes the ardupilot gazebo plugin to allow the ardupilot control software to interface and control the model boat in gazebo.
